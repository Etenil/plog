<p style="text-align: justify;">This article defines what Free software is. Although there is already plenty of resource regarding this matter, I felt like writing my own definition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The text and explanation below have been written without external reference. This is my understanding of Free software. The list of the basic freedoms comes from Richard Stallman and the official definition. It is difficult to state them more clearly, so I just took it back.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is Free software?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Free software is not a program that doesn&#8217;t cost any money. Free is to be understood as Freedom, not graatis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, a software cannot be free for it is not a being. A Free software is therefore a software that ensures the freedom of the its users. Or I should say &#8220;the freedoms&#8221;, for there are four basic freedoms that all users should be guaranteed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below is the list of those four freedoms:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The freedom to use the software</li>
<li>The freedom to modify the software</li>
<li>The freedom to share the software</li>

<li>The freedom to redistribute modified copies of the software</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">0. Freedom 0 is the right to use the software in any circumstances and for any purpose. Even if this freedom seem obvious, many non-Free programs do not provide this much.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Freedom 1 allows any user of the program to modify it to suit it to their needs or to correct annoying bugs. A program is just a tool, and any user should be given the right to repair their tools without having to beg for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Freedom 2 is a social freedom, because it is wrong to forbid people from sharing something. Copyright laws</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">have been made to be applied to companies, because it is unfair to take someone&#8217;s job, produce millions of copies and sell them without agreement. However, usual persons must be granted the right to help their friends and relative. This is why freedom 2 is important.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Freedom 3 is the freedom to make others benefit from improvements made for one. It is the freedom of sharing and collaboration. Free software communities exist thanks to this freedom, otherwise they would only be users communities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Such a program is ideal and wouldn&#8217;t be practical</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, that&#8217;s not true, a lot of people got together to develop this idea of software freedom, and nowadays Free software is the most reliable you can find. Programs like Apache or Linux perform well enough to be deployed and recommanded on critical systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if Free software has earned proven its efficiency and robustness, bear in mind that that wasn&#8217;t the initial plan at all. Free software have been made to promote and ensure software freedom. They are children of an ideal, not just practical tools.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When did the Free software movement begin?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From an historical point of view, Free software have always existed. If you had asked for a piece of program on punched card at the beginning of the 50s, you would most probably had been given it without hesitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Programming was then considered as an academic topic. There wasn&#8217;t any true software manufacturer as today. What companies were selling bck then was the hardware. A mainframe was as big as a wardrobe and very expensive. It was sold to be used by competent persons and embedded little software. The few integrated softwares all provided their source code.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later on, in the 70s, clever businessmen found that there was a way of making money out of software. However, to do so and maximise the financial return they used of copyright law and non-disclosure agreements to gain a monopoly over their piece of software, and of course, they did not share the source code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Stallman, a researcher at MIT, had always worked in a Free environment. He and his fellow hackers in MIT were sharing code without restrction, and not sharing your code was even considered treason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Stallman had is first contact with non-free software, it came from a fellow IT researcher, and he took it as a treason to their academic principles. Later on, Stallman decided that non-free software was poisoning society and that he had to react. He left his employment and created the GNU project, then the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in the 80s.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is the GNU project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The GNU project is a quite famous and popular piece of software that millions of people use every day, I am surprised that ou don&#8217;t know it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, not that much actually. The GNU project is often referred to as &#8220;Linux&#8221;. Linux is just the kernel of the GNU system, a small piece of software which sole purpose is to make the hardware available to software that run on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The GNU project integrates a tremendous amount of programs that Linux was built upon. Among the most famous, there is glibc, which allows programs to run and is as critical as Linux, gcc, without which Linux would simply not exist, gdb, bash, emacs etc&#8230;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why is Free software so important?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, Free software is important because technology and data are important nowadays. Free software is the only mean to ensure that your data will still be usable in the future. It is also the only to ensure your data is safe and kept private.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today and even more in the future, data will be exchanged on internet without barreer - or so we can hope. That means that someone somewhere else needs to be able to read the file you made. This is not possible with non-free software.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, and that is a very important point, software licenses are expensive and constraining. If non-free software companies have it their way, then how could developping countries grow at all? The smallest machine or piece of instrumentation requires a computer, therefore software to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If software is not Free, it will benefit to a few powerful and already rich, making the poor even poorer and worse, giving them no chance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why should I care?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you want it or not, whether you care or not, your personal data is already stored into computers, databases and so on by the government, the NI, the army etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While they hold this data for you, that is still YOUR data. That is why you should care. You or your government cannot trust blindly and depend on one non-free company that won&#8217;t let you peek in their work to ensure everything is safe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If they hide their software behind legal means, that is because they have something to hide, and the fact that they do means it shouldn&#8217;t be pretty. Do I need to add that most big software companies are criminals and have all had trials.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How can I make money with software if it is Free?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many ways of making money out of Free software. If you are a developer, then you could let your services and add functions to existing software. You can offer support about a piece of software that you know well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Free software business works very well and is growing at a rate of 46% per year in France, which shows that there is much to do, and a lot of money to be made.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why should technicians care about such a political idea</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Free software is indeed a political idea. But not only. Free software is more of an ethical idea. If you call IBM to get support, they will check your name against a list of terrorists, because it would be unethical to support terrorist activities. The same way, every developer must only write Free software.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developers must do that because making a program is having power over the users. But power comes with responsibilities. If you write a software, then you must respect your customers, your users. You must give them the four basic freedoms. Otherwise, the program you made will have no other effect than enslaving the users and making them helpless and divided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Helpless because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to adapt the software to their needs, or to correct a bug. Divided because they can&#8217;t give non-free software to their friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Refusing to let someone help is friend is a crime against society, because society is based on helping your friends. If you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;ll loose your friends and if no one does, no one will have friends anymore. If on top of that you forbid improvement and sharing of the improvements, the technology will stop progressing, regress and eventually the whole society will collapse.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Very well, but I still have other questions/objections</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This article is obviously not complete yet, and I wouldn&#8217;t pretend having addressed all questions at once. It will therefore be regularly updated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please post your questions / suggestions / objections in the comments, I will answer them.</p>
